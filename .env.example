# Visual Regression Settings
# ================================

# Number of daily screenshot runs to keep
# Default: 5
# The cleanup process will automatically remove older runs
# Set to a higher value if you need more history
KEEP_RUNS_COUNT = "5"

# Pixel difference threshold percentage for marking errors
# Default: 2.0 (means 2%)
# Pages with visual changes exceeding this percentage will be marked as errors
# Lower values = more sensitive (catches smaller changes)
# Higher values = less sensitive (only major changes trigger errors)
#
# Examples:
#   - 0.5  = Very sensitive (0.5% change triggers error)
#   - 2.0  = Moderate (2% change triggers error) [DEFAULT]
#   - 5.0  = Lenient (5% change triggers error)
PIXEL_DIFF_THRESHOLD = "10.0"

# ================================
# Usage Examples
# ================================
#
# Keep 10 runs instead of 5:
# KEEP_RUNS_COUNT = "10"
#
# More lenient visual comparison (5% threshold):
# PIXEL_DIFF_THRESHOLD = "5.0"
#
# More strict visual comparison (0.5% threshold):
# PIXEL_DIFF_THRESHOLD = "0.5"
